# CRUD REST API with Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, and Prisma ORM

## ðŸ“– Introduction

This project is part of my **self-taught learning journey** in backend development.  
I built this REST API to practice fundamental concepts of **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) while using modern tools like **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **Express.js**, and **Prisma ORM**.

The goal of this project is to understand how to:

- Design RESTful routes
- Connect a Node.js server to a database
- Use Prisma ORM for database interactions
- Practice writing clean and maintainable backend code

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Node.js** â€“ JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js** â€“ Fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js
- **Prisma ORM** â€“ Type-safe and modern ORM for database operations
- **Database** â€“ MySQL
- **TypeScript** â€“ a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types, to write safer and more understandable code.
